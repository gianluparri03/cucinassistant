# History

## Intro

I began this project in September 2023.
The first version of CucinAssistant was written in Python (with Flask) and used MariaDB as its database; then,
after some experiments, I've decided to rewrite it completely in Go, with PostgreSQL and HTMX.

Here is a resume of all the versions available, with their major changes.
