## What is CucinAssistant

CucinAssistant is an utility website, with which you - and your roommates - can keep track of things
related to the kitchen.

Once you log in to CucinAssistant, every change you do is synced across your devices, so you'll never forget
to buy something anymore!

In particular, CucinAssistant features a section for the menus management, a shopping list (with a two-phase checking system),
a storage section (where you can save the groceries you have, divided in groups), and a recipes section.

Right now it is currently available in English and in Italian; if you wish to add the support for another message,
you can contact me, or just open a pull request with the translations.


### Public instances

You can use it from your browser, at [https://cucinassistant.com](https://cucinassistant.com), and decide to install it,
or you can directly download the Trusted Web App from the Play Store
([here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.gianlucaparri.ca.twa)).

The content is exactly the same.
