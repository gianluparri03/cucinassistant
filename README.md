## What is CucinAssistant

CucinAssistant is an utility website, with which you - and your roommates - can
keep track of things related to the kitchen.

Once you log in to CucinAssistant, every change you do is synced across your
devices, so you'll never forget to buy something anymore!

In particular, CucinAssistant features a section for the menus management, a
shopping list (with a two-phase checking system), a storage section (where you
can save the groceries you have, divided in groups), and a recipes section
(that you can share with everyone!).

Right now it is available in English and in Italian; if you wish to add the
support for another message, you can contact me, or just open a pull request
with the translations.

For other informations, [see the info page](https://cucinassistant.com/info/en).
