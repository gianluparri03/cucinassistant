## What is CucinAssistant

CucinAssistant is an utility website, with which you - and your roommates - can keep track of things
related to the kitchen. In particular, it features, a section for the menus management, a
shopping list (with a two-phase checking system) and a storage section, where you can save the items
stored in your fridge or cupboard (even in two separate folders), both with their quantiy and their expiration
date.  


## Public instances

You can try it online, on [https://cucinassistant.com](https://cucinassistant.com), or you can also download it
from Google Play ([here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.gianlucaparri.ca.twa)); the app is a
Trusted Web Application, so it is the same of the website.
